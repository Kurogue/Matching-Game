# Matching Game

## Overview

This is a matching game that I had designed as part of final project for a class. The HTML and CSS were pre-written/given because this class focused mainly on Javascript implementation and understanding. The provided.js Javascript file was also given to the students for certain methods to work and ease of use, the students, for example grabbing elements from the HTML and sounds played in the code. The provided code also gave test cases for the students to make sure they are implenting Javascript correctly along the way.

The game itself is a matching game with 6 matching pairs, 12 cards in total. The goal is the same as any matching game in that the user tries to find all the pairs in the least amount of attempts.

### Theme

The theme of the matching game is anime as I personally have a keen interest in anime.
